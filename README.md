# LCFreeReroutePurchase
This mod allows the players to go to Rend, Dine and Titan for free!


The mod makes rerouting to other moons free no matter what so this will make custom maps free aswell, so be careful!


Works on all versions of lethal company!

# What It Looks Like

Your terminal should show the cost of Rend, Dine and Titan as 0 credits

When you route to any of the moons, there should be no cost and you just go straight there
